# justwiped
This discord bot will notify you every time a new Rust server has wiped from the website "just-wiped.net", with or without filters (cf. code comments)

If you want to run the bot yourself, you will have to modify the channel ID (you can know this by activating the Discord Developer mode (Options > Appearence) and right clicking on a channel to get its ID.

You will also need to create a bot on the Discord Developer website (https://discord.com/developers/applications) and add its token at the bottom of the code.

I made this bot to be able to know when the servers wiped according to my needs (for example duos, trios, 20+ players only, bp wiped or not, etc...). You can simply filter the server on the website, copy the link and paste it in the "url=..." area in the code.

I guess that's it. Just run it on a server so it will work indefinitly and notify you every time a server is available.
